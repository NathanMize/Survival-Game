# Survival-Game
Linux command line survival game in C++

This program is a very basic survival game that asks the player to collect food for the upcoming winter to avoid starvation. They can explore the small 5x5 map, hunt animals and forage for food and weapons. Some animals fight back. This was my final project for my first college programming course CS 165 at Oregon State. It is intended to be compiled using g++ and run from the Linux command line.
